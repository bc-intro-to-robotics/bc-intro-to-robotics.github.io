## CSC 126: Introduction to Robotics
### Berea College

---

## Announcement

- Our dates and times have been confirmed at the Berea branch of the Madison County Public Library. We will be going there Saturday, December 7 and Sunday, December 8. The time is 1-2, and you are required to come early and stay to help me to load my car with robots, so your actual time there will be more like 12:55-2:05.  Students who are late will not receive full credit, so if you know you have a problem with tardiness, I advise you to make an especial effort to be early. You are only required to come to one of these sessions, and ideally, 2 members from each team of four will come Saturday and 2 members will come on Sunday. We have one team of 3 with one member having a conflict with Saturday, so members of that team can all choose to come Sunday or can have 1-2 Saturday and 1-2 Sunday.
